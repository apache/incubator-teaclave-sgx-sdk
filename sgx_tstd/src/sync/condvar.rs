//! trusted Thread Synchronization library may make calls outside the enclave (OCALLs).
//! If you use any of the APIs below, you must first import the needed OCALL functions
//! from sgx_tstd.edl. Otherwise, you will get a linker error when the enclave is
//! being built; see Calling Functions outside the Enclave for additional details.
