//! Platform-independent platform abstraction
//!
//! This is the platform-independent portion of the standard library's
//! platform abstraction layer, whereas `std::sys` is the
//! platform-specific portion.
//!
//! The relationship between `std::sys_common`, `std::sys` and the
//! rest of `std` is complex, with dependencies going in all
//! directions: `std` depending on `sys_common`, `sys_common`
//! depending on `sys`, and `sys` depending on `sys_common` and `std`.
//! This is because `sys_common` not only contains platform-independent code,
//! but also code that is shared between the different platforms in `sys`.
//! Ideally all that shared code should be moved to `sys::common`,
//! and the dependencies between `std`, `sys_common` and `sys` all would form a dag.
//! Progress on this is tracked in #84187.
