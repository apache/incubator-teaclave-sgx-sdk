/// Sample values uniformly between two bounds.
///
/// This gives a uniform distribution (assuming the RNG used to sample
/// it is itself uniform & the `SampleRange` implementation for the
/// given type is correct), even for edge cases like `low = 0u8`,
/// `high = 170u8`, for which a naive modulo operation would return
/// numbers less than 85 with double the probability to those greater
/// than 85.
///
/// Types should attempt to sample in `[low, high)`, i.e., not
/// including `high`, but this may be very difficult. All the
/// primitive integer types satisfy this property, and the float types
/// normally satisfy it, but rounding may mean `high` can occur.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use sgx_rand::distributions::{IndependentSample, Range};
///
/// fn main() {
///     let between = Range::new(10, 10000);
///     let mut rng = sgx_rand::thread_rng();
///     let mut sum = 0;
///     for _ in 0..1000 {
///         sum += between.ind_sample(&mut rng);
///     }
///     println!("{}", sum);
/// }
